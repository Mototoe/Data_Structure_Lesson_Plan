&emsp;&ensp; Big O notaion is a mathimatical notation that we use to helps us determine how effecient different lines of code are. Effecient meaning more how much space it takes up and how fast or slow the run time is when the amount of inputs increase rather thenathe actual amount of code written. Big O notation's formula is f(n) = O(g(n)), with this we are able to get the notations which vary depends on the code.
